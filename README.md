# Pokédex Web App

## Overview

This is a simple web application that utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display a list of Pokémon on the home page. Initially, it lists 10 Pokémon, and with each click on the button, it loads an additional 10 Pokémon. The application also provides detailed information about each Pokémon on a separate page. Users can browse through the Pokémon list and click on individual Pokémon to view their details. Additionally, there is a filter at the top of the system that allows users to filter Pokémons by type.

## Features

- List all the Pokémon in groups of 10 on the home page.
- You can load 10 more Pokémons by clicking the button on home page.
- Clicking on a Pokémon's image takes you to a dedicated page with more information about that Pokémon.
- Search functionality to find Pokémons by type.
- Switch between Light and Dark themes for a better user experience.
- Responsive design for a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
